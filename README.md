# Four-Bar-Linkage-Calculator

This is a refactor of a program that I originally made for a class when I was in college.

The functionality of the code is to take the length parameters of a 4-bar linkage and perform a simulation of the motion of the linkage.

The code takes in the lengths of the linkages and outputs pictures and gifs of the crossed and open configurations of the linkage.

TODO:
Make inputs more clear in the code
Dataframe outputs to an excel file
Try storing pictures in computer RAM for making gifs instead of saving to disk
General refactoring
Unit tests
Write a proper README and make easier to understand to non-technical audience
Velocity and Acceleration and Force analysis
What are coding best practices for a repo like this?
If code quality and functionality increases, make into a library?
