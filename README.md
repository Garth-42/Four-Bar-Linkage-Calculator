# Four-Bar-Linkage-Calculator

This is a refactor of a program that I originally made for a class when I was in college.

The functionality of the code is to take the length parameters of a 4-bar linkage and perform a simulation of the motion of the linkage.

The code takes in the lengths of the linkages and outputs pictures and gifs of the crossed and open configurations of the linkage.

TODO:

Make inputs more clear in code

Make so dataframe outputs to an excel file if option configured

Try storing pictures in computer RAM for making gifs instead of saving to disk

Unit tests

Refactor for clarity

Velocity, Acceleration and Force analysis

Look up repo best practices
